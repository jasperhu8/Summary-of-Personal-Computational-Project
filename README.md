# Summary-of-Personal-Computational-Project
This repository provides a summary of my computational projects spanning biomedical AI, quantitative finance, and applied data science. These works highlight my interdisciplinary background and focus on integrating rigorous modeling with practical problem-solving.

## Biomedical AI & Data Science
- **RNA 3D Folding (Kaggle, Stanford-led Challenge)**  
  Developed an end-to-end pipeline converting raw RNA sequences into YAML configs for inference, enabling scalable batch processing. Applied **diffusion-based ML models** (Boltz-1, Protenix) and ensemble strategies for structure prediction.  

- **Prostate Cancer Multimodal AI (A*STAR Internship)**  
  Ongoing exploratory project integrating **H&E whole-slide images, MRI, and clinical data** to improve diagnosis and prognosis through cross-modal feature transfer. Currently focusing on **feature extraction from WSIs** with MONAI and PyTorch.  

- **Urban Air Quality Analysis**  
  Combined meteorological and pollution data, engineered multi-dimensional features, and trained a **random forest model** (R, ntree=100). Identified wind speed and humidity as key predictors and simulated intervention scenarios to support Beijingâ€™s air quality management.  

## Quantitative Finance & Risk Modeling
- **Three-Factor Crude Oil Futures Hedging Model**  
  Built a hedging framework incorporating **storage costs, interest rates, and market volatility**. Achieved **47% reduction in portfolio risk** compared to benchmarks, providing evidence-based support for trading strategies.  

- **SME Credit Risk Assessment (ICM Meritorious Winner, Top 7%)**  
  Designed quantitative risk models using **logistic regression and BP neural networks** to evaluate SME credit risk across four industries. Proposed an integrated risk management framework with policy insights for regulators and financial institutions.
